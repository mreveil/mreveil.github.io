One of the most cited reasons for project failure is
poor communication. But good communication is hard to get right. Here are 7
practices that have helped me as a program manager. I hope they help your team too.

### 1. Start with why

People can disagree on how to solve a problem.

But they should never disagree on:

- what the problem is
- why it must be solved
- what the world looks like when it is solved.

Spend as much time and effort at this stage until everyone is aligned.

### 2. Establish clear communication channels

Early on, you should anticipate different types of issues that people will have, and proactively create and communicate a process to address them.

No one should have to guess how to raise an issue.

### 3. Document key decisions

Verbal communication is great but easily forgotten or misremembered.

Document decisions in one location accessible to everyone.

Decision records should include:

- the issue
- background information
- options considered
- decision
- reason

### 4. Promote team self-awareness

Most problems are predictable based on the stage of the project.

Assess your team’s readiness and share your assessment with them.

Tell them the types of problems you are anticipating and how long you expect it will take to solve them.

### 5. Hold regular retrospectives

Don’t wait until the postmortem.

Schedule time for retrospectives after each milestone.

Ask: what did we do well, what did we not do well and what must change now.

Ask people to write their answers beforehand to prevent group think.

### 6. Avoid false dichotomies

People often frame problems as a choice between two extremes.

Don’t fall for it.

There’s usually a continuum of options between the extremes.

Or the choice is one of prioritization and not alternative options.

Reframe the problem quickly.

### 7. Encourage active listening

Before someone voices a disagreement, they should be able to explain the other person’s position clearly.

Otherwise they should be asking clarifying questions, not expressing disagreement.

Have this as an expectation for your team.
