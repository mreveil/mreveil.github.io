A problem well-defined is half-solved. However, in the STEM fields we spend
significant time learning how to solve problems, and little time on how to define them.

A great problem definition is how a great solution starts. In this post, I share 5 things
to keep in mind when defining a problem.

## 3 Characteristics of a Good Problem Definition

First, let's talk about what a good problem definition (PD) looks like.

### 1. It has enough contextual information.

For technical problems, the PD should be enough for other people to reproduce the issue.

For other problems, you should be able to answer the who, what, when, and how.

### 2. It states why it is a problem

Do not confuse this with why the problem occurs. This is part of solving the problem.

At this stage, you should be able to say exactly what pain this problem is causing and why it must be solved.

Nothing is worse than solving a non-problem.

### 3. It lists expected outcomes that a solution whould bring

Describe what a solution should achieve without describing the solution itself.

Ask what the world looks like when this is solved?

Your answer to this question will help differentiate between good and great solutions.

## How to arrive at a good problem definition

Now that we know some characteristics of a good problem definition, here are some advice on how to craft a good problem definition.

### Advice #1: Ask questions.

Early in our careers, we tend to take people at their words when they tell us about a problem.

It’s not until we fail many times that we realize that we are solving the wrong problem.

The truth is, people usually describe the symptoms of a problem, not the problem itself.

Sometimes, people don't even know what the problem is in the first place.

Your job at this stage is to ask questions to get more information.

Pay special attention to what is an assumption and what is a fact.

### Advice #2: Get the facts.

After asking enough question from the person who the person first raised the issue, find other people to talk to. Focus on those who have first-hand experience with the problem.

As you continue to ask questions, you’ll learn more about the knowns and the unknowns. You'll also understand what the expected outcomes are.

### Advice #3: Avoid replacing the problem.

When faced with difficult problems, we tend to swap them for easier ones instead.

Pay attention to how you frame the problem.

Describe the problem using simple words but do not make the problem simpler than it is in reality.

At this stage, you are ready to write your first draft of a problem definition.

### Advice #4: Confirm your problem definition

Now that you have a problem definition, go back to your stakeholders for validation.

Don't stop until you get a clear "yes, this is the problem" from them.

You'll be surprised at how satisfying it is to have a well-defined problem.

### Advice #5: Avoid solving too early.

The process of defining a problem can feel like a waste of time.

But it will save you valuable time when done well.

It serves as a compass and brings alignment during the problem-solving stage.

As you progress in your solutioning process, you will find yourself going back to the problem definition
to confirm that you are on the right track or to realign with your team and stakeholders.

Happy problem hunting!
