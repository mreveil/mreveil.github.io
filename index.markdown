Hello, my name is Mardoch√©e (pronouced: Mar-Dough-Shay).

I'm a currently a research associate and materials informatics program manager at [Corning Incorporated](https://corning.com).

I'm generally interested in using Artificial Intelligence to accelerate the pace of
scientific discoveries.

In particular, I'm interested in:

- How artificial intelligence can be used for materials discovery including for
  property predictions, structural characterization, etc.
- How machine learning can be used to accelerate simulations that are currently too
  computationally expensive such as molecular simulations, Density Functional Theory calculations, etc.
- How recommendation systems can be used for hypothesis generation, experiment design and candidate generation.
- How Natural Language Processing can be used to better manage scientific knowledge and data in accordance with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles.
